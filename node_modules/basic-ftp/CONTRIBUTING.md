# Contributing

Contributions are welcome!

This library has specific goals. FTP is an old protocol, there are many features, quirks and server implementations. It's not a goal to support all of them. It should provide a foundation that covers the basic needs.

## Testing

- `npm test` runs unit tests.
- `npm run tdd` runs unit tests automatically every time a file changed.
- `npm run lint` runs the linter.
